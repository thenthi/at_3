# Activity in class
**Solar system**
![solar system](solar.png)
This one I created it whenever we had a new lesson about 3D, I tried to get used to 3D by creating solar system. I thought that 3D is quite hard but it's really interesting. 

# Brainstorm for assignment 3

Theme: The Journey of Intellectual Growth and Self-Understanding – From Confusion to Confidence.

Encounter 1: Maze - symbolizes confusion and lack of direction, feel nervous, panic.

Encounter 2: A dark room with a hand reaches out to rescue - feel saved, rescued.

Encounter 3: Room of blurred insight (Books flying around, symbols floating in the air—representing ideas and inspiration) 

Encounter 4: A vibrant garden in full bloom, with a mirror standing among the flowers - An expression of personal awakening and the discovery of a clear path forward.

#  List of the assets
**Encounter 1 – Maze:**

3D models: Rectangular prism - in order to create entrances, walls, ways and also exits in this encounter.

Sounds: Muffled voices, echoing steps or dynamic lighting (flickering, shifting shadows) to enhance the feeling of confusion.

Spatial arrangements: I will arrange the rectangular prisms to create a maze that has entrance, way and exit.

I make this decision because I want to create the encounter looks confusions, so I think maze is the best option, combine with it is disorienting sound to make the player feel more anxious. 

**Encounter 2 – Dark Room:**

3D models: Black cube, 3D hand model - in order to show 

Sounds: The sound of deliverance.

Spatial arrangements: In a dimly lit room, a single hand extends from the upper corner — representing a glimmer of salvation in the midst of hopelessness.

For Encounter 2, I use these sounds and visuals to create a sense of falling into a deep hole of despair. The hand symbolizes salvation, appearing when the player is at their lowest point.

**Encounter 3 – Insight Room:**

3D models: White cube, books 3D model, sphere, cone, cylinder, pyramid,..

Sounds: cheerful music symbolizing determination.

Spatial arrangements: Books and geometric forms will be placed in a seemingly chaotic yet intentional arrangement — symbolizing an expansive universe of knowledge.

This encounter presents a space overflowing with knowledge — a symbolic environment where the player feels they are healing and absorbing new understanding.

**Encounter 4 – Garden with Mirror:**

3D models: Terrain, garden 3D models, mirror- can be 3D models or create by tools in Unity.

Sounds: Sound of peacefulness and awake.

Spatial arrangements: I will create a garden which has a lot of flowers in this, one mirror stands at the center of garden.

The garden and mirror help the player experiences happiness, delight, and a sense of fulfillment, reinforcing the theme of self-realization, achieve success after a long and difficult journey.
